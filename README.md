# Simple-Neural-Network

Simple Neural Networks of different types written in Keras.

## 1) Multi-Layer Preceptron
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is the simplest type of feedforward Neural Network. It refers to networks composed of multiple layers of neurons, with neurons in each layer fully connected to the previous layer.
